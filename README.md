### **Part 1: Algorithms** 🤯
First up: the **FizzBuzz** challenge! I've implemented a clean and readable solution. I hope you'll enjoy my approach!

**🔍 Quick recap of FizzBuzz:**
- Numbers divisible by **3**? Say _Fizz!_
- Numbers divisible by **5**? Say _Buzz!_
- Both? So **FizzBuzz!** 🎉

_The goal was simple, but I made a solution that's documented and maintainable._ 💡

### **Part 2: Backend ** 🏢 🚗
Now the main course! You asked me to design a system for managing a **fleet of vehicles** and tracking where each one is parked.

## 🔧 Project Structure
Here's a quick guide :

```

└── README.md
```

- **`algo/`**: Contains the FizzBuzz solution.
- **`backend/`**: Contains the Parking solution.
